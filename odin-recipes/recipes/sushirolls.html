    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups sushi rice</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>9 nori sheets</li>
        <li>1 cucumber</li>
        <li>1 carrot</li>
        <li>1 cup purple cabbage</li>
        <li>1 avocado</li>
        <li>1 cup sauted mushrooms</li>
        <li>4 lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>1 tbsp black sesame seeds</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash sushi rice 5 to 6 times until the water is almost clear.<br> Now in a heavy bottom pot, add rice and 4 cups of water. <br>Cook it on high flame until it starts boiling. <br>Lower the heat, stir the rice, cover the pot and cook on low heat for 12 to 15 minutes until the rice is done.<br> When the rice is cooked, the water will be absorbed completely.<br> Fluff the rice with a fork.</li>
        <li>

            In a pot add vinegar, salt and sugar.<br> Cook it on low heat until all the sugar is dissolved. <br>Now take out the cooked rice in a glass, wooden or plastic bowl and add seasoning mixture to it and mix it carefully with a wooden spoon as metal bowl or spoon will react with vinegar. <br>Let the rice cool down completely at room temperature.<br>

        <li>Prepare all the vegetables to make sushi rolls.</li>
        <li>Now place the bamboo mat on a worktop and cover it with the clear plastic so that it does not get messy.<br> Place nori sheet keeping shining side down.<br> Wet your hands, take some rice, place it on the sheet.<br> Spread it evenly leaving the edge on top.<br> Now arrange veggies at the bottom.</li>
        <li>Now lift the end of the mat near you and start rolling it tightly. Apply some water at the other end and press the roll.<br> Prepare all the rolls.</li>
        <li>Take a sharp knife, dip it in the water to avoid sticking of rice on the knife. Now cut the rolls in half first and then into smaller pieces.</li>
        <li>You can even keep the rice layer on top to make it differently.<br> To make this, spread the rice in the same way and sprinkle sesame seeds on top, but then you have to turn it down and place your stuffing.<br> Lift the mat and make a tight roll.<br> Cut it into small pieces.</li>
        <li>Serve vegetarian sushi rolls with pickled ginger, wasabi, soya sauce and peri mayonnaise.</li>
